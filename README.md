Hello and Welcome!
I'm Stuart, a software engineer working in JavaScript, React, Redux, Next.JS, MongoDB and Ruby on Rails (as well as SQL, ActiveRecord, HTML, and CSS).

I love building and brainstorming new projects, learning new languages and coding patterns, and puzzling through challenges.

Since graduating from Flatiron I have built an e-commerce store using Next.JS for the frontend and MongoDB for the backend. Material-UI was also implemented for CSS.

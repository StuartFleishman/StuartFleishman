Hi! My name is Stuart and I am Software Engineer with a certificate from Flatironâ€™s Full-Stack Web Development course.

I have a strong knowledge of JavaScript, React.JS and Redux. Together these three things allow me to implement amazing frontend experiences.

My backend engineer training is in Ruby on Rails & Sinatra. Basic knowledge of the web: REST apis, HTTP requests, MVC, SQL, CRUD.

Since graduating from Flatiron I have built an e-commerce store using Next.JS for the frontend and MongoDB for the backend. Material-UI was also implemented for CSS.
